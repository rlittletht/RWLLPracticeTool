<ul>
    <li>
        After booting Outlook, go to your Calendars by clicking on the Calendar icon in the lower left corner of your screen:<br/><img src="SelectCalendar.png" alt="Select Calendar"/>
    </li>
    <p>At this point you should see your calender(s) in the main window, and a list of calendars on the left side</p>
    <li>
        Now right click on "Other Calendars", select Add Calender, and choose From Internet:<br/><img src="AddInternetCalendar.png" alt="Add Internet Calendar"/>
    </li>
    <li>
        You will be prompted to enter the location of the internet calendar. This is where you paste in the link that you copied from the practice tool:<br/><img src="NewCalendarDialog.png" alt="New Calendar Dialog"/>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you click OK, and click OK again on the next dialog, you will be subscribed to the calendar you selected in the practice tool.  If you ever want to remove this calendar in the future, just right click on the calendar (under Other Calendars) and choose Delete.</p>
